# Polynomial
To ensure that all coefficients of 
$$P(\Delta_2(Q^\pi(G_{1,b+1,c+1})),x+e(G)+3-\frac{1.5}{n})$$
are positive,
we partition the consideration into two parts, one is about  $t_1=1,t_2,t_3\geq 1$, and the other is about $t_1\geq 2,t_2,t_3\geq 0$.

When $t_1=1,t_2,t_3\geq 1$, let $t_1=1,t_2=b+1,t_3=c+1$;
when $t_1\geq 2,t_2,t_3\geq 0$, let $t_1=a+2,t_2=b,t_3=c$.
We first present the characteristic polynomial of 2-th additive compound matrix:

$$P(\Delta_2(Q^\pi(G_{1,b+1,c+1})),x+e(G)+3-\frac{1.5}{n})\ when\ t_1=1,t_2,t_3\geq 1,$$
$$P(\Delta_2(Q^\pi(G_{a+2,b,c})),x+e(G)+3-\frac{1.5}{n})\ when\ t_1\geq 2,t_2,t_3\geq 0.$$

We checked all coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are positive ($a,b,c\geq0$).
